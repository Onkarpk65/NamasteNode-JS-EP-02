## Episode-02 | JS on Server
----------------------------------------------------------------
- In this lecture, we have learned about an important concept of how **JS works on Server**
<br> 
*What is a server?*
<br>

- It is a computer or system that provides data, services, resources, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
<br>

- **Behind the scenes,** when a computer needs to communicate with a server, it sends a request to the server using its **IP address.** Initially, *Javascript* could only be executed within *web-browsers*, limiting its use of *client-side tasks.* However, with the *introduction* of **Node.js,** JavaScript can now also be executed on servers, allowing developers to use the same language for both client-side and server side programming.
<br>
*What is IP Address?* 
<br>

 - An IP address, or Internet Protocol Address, is a unique number that identifies every device connected to the Internet.
<br>

- Node.js came up with a philosophy that it can run outside the web-broswers, primarily on server.
- Node.js is written in C++ language,which runs on the system with the help of **V8 Engine**
- Node.js is a **C++ App** with **V8 Engine** embedded onto it.
<br>
*What is V8?*
<br>

- V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and Web Assembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements*ECMAScript* and *Web Assembly*, and runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux systems. V8 can be embedded into any C++ application.
- The **V8 JavaScript engine** is written in **C++**.
- The process works as follows:
- JavaScript code is executed by V8, which then compiles it down to machine code that the computer can execute.
- When user writes a *JS code* (High Level Language Code).
- that code is taken by *C++* i.e *V8 engine* (converts the High Level Language Code to Low Level language Code).
- Low level meaning the code is then beign understood by Machine & Assembly Code.
- and then, afterwards that Low level code is being understood by Binary Code.

# ECMAScript:
<br>

- *ECMAScript* is a standard for scripting languages, including JS, JScript, and ActionScript. It is best know as the standard that defines Javascript.
- *ECMAScript standards* are followed by JavaScript engines like **V8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra,** and others to ensure consistent behaviours across different environments.
- Different browsers use different types of *JS engines* 
- **Google** uses *V8 Engine*
- **Firefox** uses *SpiderMonkey*
- **Microsoft Edge** uses *Chakra**
- **Safari** uses *JavaScript Core (WebKit)*
